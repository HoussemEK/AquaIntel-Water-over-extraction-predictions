# AquaIntel-Water-over-extraction-predictions
AquaIntel uses AI to optimize groundwater recharge, find ideal aquifer sites, and prevent over-extraction, protecting the environment, water resources, and ensuring sustainable agriculture practices.

The datasets used were provided by The Acea Group one of the leading Italian multiutility operators. Listed on the Italian Stock Exchange since 1999, the company manages and develops water and electricity networks and environmental services. Acea is the foremost Italian operator in the water services sector supplying 9 million inhabitants in Lazio, Tuscany, Umbria, Molise, Campania.

This data set contains nine different datasets, completely independent and not linked to each other. Each dataset can represent a different kind of waterbody. As each waterbody is different from the other, the related features as well are different from each other. only 4 were used as we chose to focus on water aquifer over extraction

in the python notebook provided you will find:
-EDA
-Feature Engineering
-Predictions
